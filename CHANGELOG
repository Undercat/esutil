v1.1 - 2020-04-30

  Added a feature to create "hidden properties" in objects produced by Type.create(),
  or extended with Type.add(). These hidden properties use accessors (getters/setters)
  to manipulate the actual data, which is held in a data object that need not, but can be,
  referenced in the returned object.

v1.0 - 2020-02-15

  Initial release.
